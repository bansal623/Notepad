#Implementation

Don't start writing code directly. Make the test cases first. In this application there are many test cases. So wrote them first and then implement accordingly.

For eg. When you click on New, you have to check that whether you are currently in a saved document state or unsaved state.
If you are in saved state, then clicking New will open New blank screen for you otherwise a popup with Do you want to save your document (Yes/No/Cancel).

I have implemented this using Stack (Last In First Out). Using stack I am able to satisfy all test cases by using push, pop and peek operations.

Counters are definitely used to implement your logic correctly along with some Data Structure.
